        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Our primary target audience consists of individuals between the ages of 18 to 45 who enjoy adventurous trips and prefer a hassle-free experience. They include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Working Professionals:</b> Individuals with busy schedules who benefit from a streamlined travel-planning process.</li>
            <li><b>Technology-Savvy Users:</b> Customers comfortable using mobile applications and seeking a high-quality, cross-platform experience.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>To understand the pain points and preferences of our target audience, we conducted extensive user research:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>User Interviews</b><br>We conducted one-on-one interviews with 4 participants (aged 25-47) via Zoom and in-person to gain insight into users' frustrations with existing travel apps.</li>
            <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Participants found travel information scattered across different platforms.</li>

                <li>Group travel and exclusive promotions were key features that participants sought in a travel app.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
        
            <li><b>Surveys</b><br>We conducted a survey using UX Tweak with 7 participants to understand users' preferences when booking travel online.</li>
            <p>Key Findings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most participants preferred mobile apps over desktop apps for booking travel.</li>

        <h2>Personas Development</h2>
        <p>From our research, we identified key user behavior patterns and developed six personas to guide our design process. These personas helped us prioritize features and tailor the user experience to specific needs, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Busy professionals seeking efficiency in travel planning.</li>
            <li>Group travelers looking for shared itineraries and personalized recommendations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>Our design process followed a user-centered approach, incorporating research insights into every stage of development. We used the Five Planes of UX to structure the project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Strategy Plane:</b> We defined the product objectives based on user needs, ensuring that the app focused on a seamless, hassle-free experience.</li>
            <li><b>Scope Plane:</b> We identified key features, such as booking flights, accommodations, and car rentals, alongside feedback collection and travel recommendations.</li>
            <li><b>Structure Plane:</b> We designed the information architecture, ensuring logical and intuitive navigation through the app’s core features.</li>
            <li><b>Skeleton Plane:</b> We outlined the layout of buttons, controls, and images to create an efficient and aesthetically pleasing interface.</li>
            <li><b>Surface Plane:</b> The final design featured a clean, modern visual aesthetic with a color palette that reflects the excitement of travel, while the typography (Roboto and Poppins) ensured readability and accessibility.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Card Sorting & Information Architecture</h2>
        <p>We used both open and closed card sorting methods to design the information architecture of Travel Whiz.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Closed Card Sorting:</b> Participants sorted travel-related content into pre-defined categories, allowing us to refine the app's content organization.</li>
            <li><b>Open Card Sorting:</b> Participants created their own categories, providing insight into how users naturally group travel-related information. This helped us ensure that the app’s navigation aligned with user expectations.</li>
        </ul>

        <img id= "sorting" src="/images/travelwhizSorting.png" alt="TravelWhiz4">

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>Usability testing played a crucial role in refining Travel Whiz’s user interface. We tested the app with 3 participants (aged 20-40, travel lovers) to evaluate the user experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Testing Objectives:</b> Measure the time required to complete key tasks (e.g., creating an account, navigating the app), identify unintended task sequences or extra steps, and evaluate the visual interface, including the placement of buttons, link size, and color contrast.</li>
            <li><b>Key Insights:</b> Participants found the navigation intuitive and easy to use, feedback highlighted a desire for more vibrant colors to enhance the visual appeal, and all participants were able to contact customer support with ease, confirming the effectiveness of this feature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Error Handling</h2>
        <p>We prioritized clear and helpful error messages to improve the user experience. Error messages were displayed in context, allowing users to quickly correct mistakes without frustration.</p>

        <h2>Onboarding</h2>
        <p>A smooth onboarding experience is essential for user retention. Travel Whiz’s onboarding process was designed to quickly familiarize users with the app's core features, reducing churn and increasing engagement.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Travel Whiz successfully bridges the gap between travel planning and execution by offering a personalized, seamless, and enjoyable experience for users. Our research-driven design ensures that Travel Whiz meets the needs of modern travelers, providing them with everything they need in one convenient app. By simplifying the travel planning process, Travel Whiz helps users focus on what matters most – enjoying their journey.</p>
        <p>This project demonstrates our team’s ability to conduct thorough research, design intuitive interfaces, and deliver a user-centered product that solves real-world problems.</p>
